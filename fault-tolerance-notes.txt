circuit breaker -> when something is wrong, don't call that service for a little while
		- need a fall back instead

circuit breaker parameters -> 
	when does breaker trip?
		last n requests to consier for the decision
		how many of those requests failed
		the timeout duration -> at what point do you consider a request a failiure
	when does circuit untrip?
		how long to wait until trying again?

steps to use hystrix (although it probably should not be used as it is no longer actively maintained)
	add dependency to project
	add @EnableCircuitBreaker to app class
	add @HystrixCommand to methods that need circuit breaker

you basically can't use private methods for @HystrixCommand methods and fallbacks. This is because hystrix
wraps your resource (controller) in a proxy and if the call on a controller method uses a private method
the proxy can't handle the call coming from within the resource. The solution is to extract those calls into
different classes and you can inject those as services
