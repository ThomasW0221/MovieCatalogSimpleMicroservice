eureka server -> just add @EnableEurekaServer annotation to main class
		add properties:
			server.port=8761
			eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
			eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

eureka client -> properties in pom.xml, add <spring-cloud.version></spring-cloud.version>
		add dependency management block for spring cloud dependencies (can be found in pom.xmls)
		@EnableEurekaClient -> not required but good for clarity
		add spring.application.name to app properties

@LoadBalanced -> does service discovery along with load balancing
		put this on RestTemplate bean definition (or webclient) to tell it not to go to that route
		directy, instead app name is like a hint at where to look in eureka server
